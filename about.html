        <div class="section-title">ABOUT</div>

    <p>
      Edith Alguero is a visual artist and concept designer from Boston, now based in Rhode Island. Her process begins with pen and paper, allowing ideas to evolve organically through drawing and hands-on experimentation. Inspired by video games and the original stories she creates, her work blends emotion, symbolism, and the surreal, with garments that feel like artifacts from alternate realities or echoes of untold myths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith Alguero’s creative journey began at Boston Arts Academy, where she explored visual arts and developed a foundation in drawing and design. Her passion for imagining worlds and creating original concepts led her to Parsons School of Design, where she focused on fashion design while continuing to nurture her love of illustration and concept art. At Parsons, she refined her design and sewing skills, interned for Mondo Guerra on a project with Lizzo, and contributed to her professor’s brand Occhii for the 2025 Fall Collection, gaining hands-on experience in professional fashion and collaborative projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside fashion, Edith actively pursued digital and traditional concept art, taking courses and experimenting with visual storytelling. This dual focus allows her to bring imagined worlds to life, merging hands-on design, illustration, and digital experimentation into work that balances creativity, narrative, and craft.
