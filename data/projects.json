      "description": "This collection tells a story of transformation and memory, inspired by the raven as a guide between worlds in Celtic mythology. Each garment moves between the known and the unknown—layered silhouettes, asymmetry, and iridescent fabrics trace the journey of change, grief, and discovery. It's a reflection on thresholds, the uncanny, and the spaces where the familiar becomes strange, inviting the viewer to step into a world suspended between reality and myth.",

      "description": "Projected Nightmares examines the universal experience of nightmares and the feelings they evoke. The first part of the collection draws from porcelain’s delicate strength and idyllic imagery, reimagined through custom toile de jouy patterns that translate subconscious anxieties into tactile form. In the second part, these patterns are projected onto the garments and hand-painted in gold, reminiscent of kintsugi, merging technology with craft to highlight the beauty within fragility and imperfection. Layered silhouettes, asymmetry, and tactile textures invite the viewer to inhabit a space where fear, memory, and transformation coexist, turning nightmares into something both unsettling and luminous.",

      "description": "This collection explores the intersection of fashion and biological engineering, developed in collaboration with my brother, a biological engineer. Through interviews and research into emerging materials—mycelium leather, bioplastics, velcro-inspired innovations, and other bio-based textiles—I investigated how biological engineering can inform both the function and form of garments. The collection translates these materials and concepts into futuristic silhouettes, textures, and details, highlighting adaptability, sustainability, and the potential of science-driven design. It reflects a dialogue between artistic vision and scientific innovation, showing how interdisciplinary collaboration can expand the possibilities of fashion.",

      "description": "Inspired by the art of ornamental ironwork, this collection explores the interplay of structure, pattern, and fantasy. Through research, interviews with ironwork artisans, and hands-on experimentation with the craft, I reinterpreted traditional motifs into voluminous silhouettes, intricate details, and layered forms that evoke a fairytale aesthetic. The garments mirror the tension of iron—strong yet delicate—while translating the precision and artistry of the craft into fashion. This collection celebrates the fusion of traditional techniques with imaginative design, inviting the wearer into a world where craft becomes narrative and structure transforms into whimsy.",

All assets were UV mapped and imported into Adobe Substance Painter, where custom textures were hand-painted and exported across multiple texture maps. The character was fully rigged and animated with a short motion test. Final rendering used Arnold materials to achieve a stylized toon line effect, supported by scene building, lighting, and final image renders.",

      "excerpt": "This illustration of Clove (VALORANT) functions as a character design study, focused on visual language, mood, and form. Developed over 24 hours of concentrated pen-to-screen work, the piece explores how an existing character can be reinterpreted while remaining cohesive within an established game universe. Emphasis was placed on silhouette, color harmony, and attitude to reflect Clove’s identity, while incorporating my own stylistic sensibilities and interest in expressive, narrative-driven character design.",

      "excerpt": "This project involved designing and fabricating two rings inspired by a chosen landscape. I drew inspiration from Ionia (Runeterra), referencing its mountains and winding vines to inform the organic, layered forms of the rings. The rings were first carved in wax using files and a wax pen, starting from standard wax ring blanks. This process emphasized accuracy in ring sizing and maintaining true dimensions for casting. After casting the rings in silver, one ring was selected for stone setting. A minimum of two cabochons were bezel set into the cast form, integrating the stones into the flowing landscape-inspired structure. I chose carnelian for the settings to reflect the red color of the inspiration photo. The final pieces were refined through sanding and polishing to highlight the sculptural surfaces and stone settings.",

After sawing and assembling the form, the pendant and hand-fabricated chain were refined through extensive sanding and polishing to unify the surface while preserving material distinction.",

      "excerpt": "This cuff project introduced core jewelry-making techniques, including sawing, sanding, texturing, riveting, annealing, and forming. Using the randomly assigned words butter and stamps, I developed three cuff designs inspired by ornamental butter knives, whose engraved patterns resemble stamped surfaces. I selected brass for its warm yellow tone, conceptually referencing butter. The metal was repeatedly annealed to soften it for both forming and texturizing, allowing for controlled bending and surface manipulation. Linear texture was created by running wire through a rolling mill, producing marks that evoke the motion of spreading butter. The cuff was finished through progressive sanding and polishing, and flat-topped rivets made from 18-gauge wire were added along one edge, reinforcing the stamped motif through rhythm and repetition.",

The name draws from solarium and the Latin solarius, meaning “relating to the sun,” paired with “soul” to reflect a balance between light, dreaming, and introspection. Visually, the logo embraces clean design with subtle symbolism: a serif typeface that shifts from bold to light references moon phases, with a waxing crescent forming the “O” to signify growth and ambition. Yellow and purple merge solar and lunar themes, while the paired “I”s nod to duality and personal meaning. Designed to function across portfolios, games, and social platforms, the logo evokes a dreamy, elegant, and slightly mysterious tone aligned with my creative work.",
